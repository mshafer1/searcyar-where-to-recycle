# where-to-recycle
Most of us are familiar with what our local recycling center accepts for recycling. 
Beyond that, many things that we throw away can either be reused or recycled. 

For instance:
* Lowes will take old Christmas lights and 
* UPS takes used packing peanuts and bubble wrap! 

The problem is, most people don't know where to take these "non-traditional recycling items." 
That's why our robotics team has compiled a list of places in Central Arkansas that recycles non-traditional items and reusable items for yours, and others, benefit.
